# Halite 3 Beginner
Halite is an open source artificial intelligence challenge, created by Two Sigma.

[Halite III](https://halite.io/) is a resource management game. Where the goal is to build a bot that efficiently navigates the seas collecting halite, a luminous energy resource.

Here is my competition profile as [mineshj1291](https://halite.io/user/?user_id=1555).

I am trying to propose here few strategies and implementation details. You are always welcome to comment below.
